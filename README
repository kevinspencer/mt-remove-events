mt-remove-events

Every once in a while, Movable Type's ActionStream pulgin pulls in duplicate
links into the mt_profileevent table.  Many many duplicates actually.

Instead of debugging and fixing the problem within MT itself, this is a hack
to find those duplicates in the table and remove them.

USAGE

    ./mt-remove-events
